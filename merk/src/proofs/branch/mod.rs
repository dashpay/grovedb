//! Branch queries for splitting large tree proofs into manageable chunks.
//!
//! This module provides two query types:
//!
//! 1. **Trunk Query** (count-based): Returns top N levels of a count tree, with
//!    optimal depth splitting. Only works on CountTree, CountSumTree, and
//!    ProvableCountTree.
//!
//! 2. **Branch Query** (key-based): Traverses to a key, returns subtree from
//!    that point to specified depth. Works on any tree type.
//!
//! Both return proof structures (verifiable against root hash) with
//! `Node::Hash` for truncated children beyond the specified depth.
